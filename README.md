# PowerCast AI 🔋

PowerCast AI is a time-series forecasting project where I am building a machine learning model to predict future energy consumption using historical household electricity usage data. The goal of this project is to understand consumption patterns and develop an AI-based forecasting system that can help in smarter energy planning.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Energy consumption forecasting is important for efficient power management, load balancing, and cost optimization. 

The objective of this project is to:
- Analyze historical household energy usage data
- Identify patterns and trends over time
- Build forecasting models to predict future energy consumption
- Evaluate model performance using proper metrics

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the **Household Electric Power Consumption Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The dataset contains:
- Date and time information
- Global active power consumption
- Voltage and other electrical measurements
